HI, My name is Dolapo and I am comp sci dropout. I droped out in 2018, my junior yr of college.  
When I went I first went to college in 2015 it really hard and I did not have the will, hope and bravery to keep on.
I was lost, probaly still am but I have a lot more hope, bravery and will. That should count for something.
Almost 4 years later I have learned that crafting for both for the digtial world and physical world is my puropse.
I like building things, just about about anyhting. One word to describe is Architect.
Here is ny first code in 4 yrs (do not know what call a body of code)
